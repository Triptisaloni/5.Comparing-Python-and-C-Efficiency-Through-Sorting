# 5.Comparing-Python-and-C-Efficiency-Through-Sorting

Summary:

Introduction

Programming languages are vital components of the computer industry

Background

Different sorting algorithms:- Quick sort, Merge sort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort

Objectives

1st - to compare the differences between C++ and Python
2nd - to compare algorithms

Methods

Carry Out Methods
Algorithms for - Quick sort, Merge sort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort

Results

The results of the comparison between Python and c++ are described, analyzed and discussed
Our results show which programming language is the better suited for each of the algorithms that we tested.
